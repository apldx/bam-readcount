  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the original publication of the VCF and SAM
              formats, an explosion of software tools have been created to
              process these data files. To facilitate this a library was
              produced out of the original SAMtools implementation, with a
              focus on performance and robustness. The file formats themselves
              have become international standards under the jurisdiction of the
              Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. FINDINGS: We present a
              software library for providing programmatic access to sequencing
              alignment and variant formats. It was born out of the widely used
              SAMtools and BCFtools applications. Considerable improvements
              have been made to the original code plus many new features
              including newer access protocols, the addition of the CRAM file
              format, better indexing and iterators, and better use of
              threading. CONCLUSION: Since the original Samtools release,
              performance has been considerably improved, with a BAM read-write
              loop running 5 times faster and BAM to SAM conversion 13 times
              faster (both using 16 threads, compared to Samtools 0.1.19).
              Widespread adoption has seen HTSlib downloaded >1 million times
              from GitHub and conda. The C library has been used directly by an
              estimated 900 GitHub projects and has been incorporated into
              Perl, Python, Rust, and R, significantly expanding the number of
              uses via other languages. HTSlib is open source and is freely

              analyzed blood-derived sequence data from 2,728 individuals from
              TCGA and discovered 77 blood-specific mutations in
              cancer-associated genes, the majority being associated with
              advanced age. Remarkably, 83\% of these mutations were from 19
              leukemia and/or lymphoma-associated genes, and nine were
              recurrently mutated (DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2, ASXL1, TP53, GNAS,

              simulated climate warming. Pooled DNA sequencing of parental and
              offspring populations showed that warming populations experienced
              greater genetic divergence from their parents, than control
              populations. In a common environment, offspring from warming
              populations showed more convergent phenotypes in seven out of
              nine plant traits, with later flowering and larger biomass, than
              plants from control populations. For both traits, we also found a
              significantly higher ratio of phenotypic to genetic
              differentiation across generations for warming than for control
              populations, indicating stronger response to selection under

              for somatic mutations using high-throughput sequencing involves a
              crucial step in precise clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy.
              However, the complex inherent features of cancer tissue,
              especially, tumor genetic intra-heterogeneity coupled with the
              problem of sequencing and alignment artifacts, makes somatic
              variant calling a challenging task. Current variant filtering
              strategies, such as rule-based filtering and consensus voting of
              different algorithms, have previously helped to increase
              specificity, although comes at the cost of sensitivity. METHODS:
              In light of this, we have developed the NeoMutate framework which
              incorporates 7 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to
              exploit the strengths of multiple variant callers, using a
              non-redundant set of biological and sequence features. We
              benchmarked NeoMutate by simulating more than 10,000 bona fide
              cancer-related mutations into three well-characterized Genome in
              a Bottle (GIAB) reference samples. RESULTS: A robust and
              exhaustive evaluation of NeoMutate's performance based on 5-fold
              cross validation experiments, in addition to 3 independent tests,
              demonstrated a substantially improved variant detection accuracy
              compared to any of its individual composite variant callers and
              consensus calling of multiple tools. CONCLUSIONS: We show here
              that integrating multiple tools in an ensemble ML layer optimizes
              somatic variant detection rates, leading to a potentially
              improved variant selection framework for the diagnosis and

                Specifically, the limit of VAF detection is closely related to
                the depth of coverage, due to the requirement of multiple
                supporting reads in extant methods, precluding the detection of
                mutations at VAFs that are orders of magnitude lower than the
                depth of coverage. Nevertheless, the ability to detect
                cancer-associated mutations in ultra low VAFs is a fundamental

              oncology approaches require robust elucidation of the genomic
              landscape of a patient's cancer and, ideally, the ability to
              monitor therapy-induced genomic changes in the tumour in an
              inexpensive and minimally invasive manner. Thanks to recent
              advances in sequencing technologies, 'liquid biopsy', the
              sampling of patient's bodily fluids such as blood and urine, is
              considered as one of the most promising approaches to achieve
              this goal. In many cancer patients, and especially those with
              advanced metastatic disease, deep sequencing of circulating cell
              free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from patient's blood yields a mixture
              of reads originating from the normal DNA and from multiple tumour
              subclones-called circulating tumour DNA or ctDNA. The ctDNA/cfDNA
              ratio as well as the proportion of ctDNA originating from
              specific tumour subclones depend on multiple factors, making
              comprehensive detection of mutations difficult, especially at
              early stages of cancer. Furthermore, sensitive and accurate
              detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels from
              cfDNA is constrained by several factors such as the sequencing
              errors and PCR artifacts, and mapping errors related to repeat
              regions within the genome. In this article, we introduce SiNVICT,
              a computational method that increases the sensitivity and
              specificity of SNV and indel detection at very low variant allele
              frequencies. SiNVICT has the capability to handle multiple
              sequencing platforms with different error properties; it
              minimizes false positives resulting from mapping errors and other
              technology specific artifacts including strand bias and low base
              quality at read ends. SiNVICT also has the capability to perform
              time-series analysis, where samples from a patient sequenced at
              multiple time points are jointly examined to report locations of
              interest where there is a possibility that certain clones were
              wiped out by some treatment while some subclones gained selective
              advantage. RESULTS: We tested SiNVICT on simulated data as well
              as prostate cancer cell lines and cfDNA obtained from
              castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. On both simulated
              and biological data, SiNVICT was able to detect SNVs and indels
              with variant allele percentages as low as 0.5\%. The lowest
              amounts of total DNA used for the biological data where SNVs and
              indels could be detected with very high sensitivity were 2.5 ng
              on the Ion Torrent platform and 10 ng on Illumina. With increased
              sequencing and mapping accuracy, SiNVICT might be utilized in
              clinical settings, making it possible to track the progress of
              point mutations and indels that are associated with resistance to
              cancer therapies and provide patients personalized treatment. We
              also compared SiNVICT with other popular SNV callers such as
              MuTect, VarScan2 and Freebayes. Our results show that SiNVICT
              performs better than these tools in most cases and allows further

              and Participants: Plasma samples were obtained from August 4,
              2013, to July 31, 2015, at a single academic institution (British
              Columbia Cancer Agency) from 65 patients with mCRPC. We collected
              temporal plasma samples (at baseline, 12 weeks, end of treatment)
              for circulating cfDNA and performed array comparative genomic
              hybridization copy number profiling and deep AR gene sequencing.
              Samples collected at end of treatment were also subjected to
              targeted sequencing of 19 prostate cancer-associated genes.
              Exposure: Enzalutamide, 160 mg, daily orally. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: Prostate-specific antigen response rate (decline
              $\geq$50\% from baseline confirmed $\geq$3 weeks later).
              Radiographic (as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 Criteria)
              and/or clinical progression (defined as worsening disease-related
              symptoms necessitating a change in anticancer therapy and/or
              deterioration in Eastern Cooperative Group performance status
              $\geq$2 levels). Results: The 65 patients had a median
              (interquartile range) age of 74 (68-79) years. Prostate-specific
              antigen response rate to enzalutamide treatment was 38\% (25 of
              65), while median clinical/radiographic progression-free survival
              was 3.5 (95\% CI, 2.1-5.0) months. Cell-free DNA was isolated
              from 122 of 125 plasma samples, and targeted sequencing was
              successful in 119 of 122. AR mutations and/or copy number
              alterations were robustly detected in 48\% (31 of 65) and 60\%
              (18 of 30) of baseline and progression samples, respectively.
              Detection of AR amplification, heavily mutated AR ($\geq$2
              mutations), and RB1 loss were associated with worse
              progression-free survival, with hazard ratios of 2.92 (95\% CI,
              1.59-5.37), 3.94 (95\% CI, 1.46-10.64), and 4.46 (95\% CI,
              2.28-8.74), respectively. AR mutations exhibited clonal selection
              during treatment, including an increase in
              glucocorticoid-sensitive AR L702H and promiscuous AR T878A in
              patients with prior abiraterone treatment. At the time of
              progression, cfDNA sequencing revealed mutations or copy number
              changes in all patients tested, including clinically actionable
              alterations in DNA damage repair genes and PI3K pathway genes,
              and a high frequency (4 of 14) of activating CTNNB1 mutations.
              Conclusions and Relevance: Clinically informative genomic
              profiling of cfDNA was feasible in nearly all patients with mCRPC
              and can provide important insights into enzalutamide response and
              resistance.",

              meningitis) differ genetically from those recovered from non-CNS
              samples. Methods: Enrichment-based deep sequencing of 45 VZV
              genomes from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), plasma, bronchoalveolar
              lavage (BAL), and vesicles was carried out with samples collected
              from 34 patients with and without VZV infection of the CNS.
              Results: Viral sequences from multiple sites in the same patient
              were identical at the consensus level. Virus from vesicle fluid
              and CSF in cases of meningitis showed low-level diversity. By
              contrast, plasma, BAL, and encephalitis had higher numbers of
              variant alleles. Two CSF-encephalitis samples had high genetic
              diversity, with variant frequency patterns typical of mixed
              infections with different clades. Conclusions: Low viral genetic
              diversity in vesicle fluid is compatible with previous
              observations that VZV skin lesions arise from single or low
              numbers of virions. A similar result was observed in VZV from
              cases of VZV meningitis, a generally self-limiting infection. CSF
              from cases of encephalitis had higher diversity with evidence for
              mixed clade infections in 2 cases. We hypothesize that

              investigation into using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to
              monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA and track the appearance and spread of
              COVID-19 in communities. SARS-CoV-2 is present at low levels in
              wastewater, making sample concentration a prerequisite for
              sensitive detection and utility in WBE. Whereas common methods
              for isolating viral genetic material are biased toward intact
              virus isolation, it is likely that a relatively low percentage of
              the total SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in wastewater is contained within
              intact virions. Therefore, we hypothesized that a direct unbiased
              total nucleic acid(TNA) extraction method could overcome the
              cumbersome protocols, variability and low recovery rates
              associated with the former methods. This led to development of a
              simple, rapid, and modular alternative to existing purification
              methods. In an initial concentration step, chaotropic agents are
              added to raw sewage allowing binding of nucleic acid from free
              nucleoprotein complexes, partially intact, and intact virions to
              a silica matrix. The eluted nucleic acid is then purified using
              manual or semi-automated methods. RT-qPCR enzyme mixes were
              formulated that demonstrate substantial inhibitor resistance. In
              addition, multiplexed probe-based RT-qPCR assays detecting the
              N1, N2 (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) gene fragments of
              SARS-CoV-2 were developed. The RT-qPCR assays also contain
              primers and probes to detect Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), a
              fecal indicator RNA virus present in wastewater, and an exogenous
              control RNA to measure effects of RT-qPCR inhibitors. Using this
              workflow, we monitored wastewater samples from three wastewater
              treatment plants (WWTP) in Dane County, Wisconsin. We also
              successfully sequenced a subset of samples to ensure
              compatibility with a SARS-CoV-2 amplicon panel and demonstrated
              the potential for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection. Data obtained

              between patterns of mutations and epigenetic phenotypes are not
              yet clear. METHODS: We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically
              annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either whole-genome
              sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases),
              along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA-methylation
              analysis. RESULTS: AML genomes have fewer mutations than most
              other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found
              in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are
              recurrently mutated in AML. A total of 23 genes were
              significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or
              more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous

              nucleophosmin (NPM1) (27\%), tumor-suppressor genes (16\%),
              DNA-methylation-related genes (44\%), signaling genes (59\%),
              chromatin-modifying genes (30\%), myeloid transcription-factor
              genes (22\%), cohesin-complex genes (13\%), and
              spliceosome-complex genes (14\%). Patterns of cooperation and
              mutual exclusivity suggested strong biologic relationships among
              several of the genes and categories. CONCLUSIONS: We identified
              at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all AML samples
              and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes
              to AML pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from
              this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for
              further investigations of AML pathogenesis, classification, and
              risk stratification. (Funded by the National Institutes of

  abstract = "Accurate drug resistance detection is key for guiding effective
              tuberculosis treatment. While genotypic resistance can be rapidly
              detected by molecular methods, their application is challenged by
              mixed mycobacterial populations comprising both susceptible and
              resistant cells (heteroresistance). For this, next-generation
              sequencing (NGS) based approaches promise the determination of
              variants even at low frequencies. However, accurate methods for a
              valid detection of low-frequency variants in NGS data are
              currently lacking. To tackle this problem, we developed the
              variant detection tool binoSNP which allows the determination of
              low-frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NGS
              datasets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains.
              By taking a reference-mapped file as input, binoSNP evaluates
              each genomic position of interest using a binomial test
              procedure. binoSNP was validated using in-silico, in-vitro, and
              serial patient isolates datasets comprising varying genomic
              coverage depths (100-500$\times$) and SNP allele frequencies
              (1-30\%). Overall, the detection limit for low-frequency SNPs
              depends on the combination of coverage depth and allele frequency
              of the resistance-associated mutation. binoSNP allows for valid
              detection of resistance associated SNPs at a 1\% frequency with a
              coverage $\geq$400$\times$. In conclusion, binoSNP provides a
              valid approach to detect low-frequency resistance-mediating SNPs
              in NGS data from clinical MTBC strains. It can be implemented in
              automated, end-user friendly analysis tools for NGS data and is a
              step forward towards individualized TB therapy.",

              research and particularly in clinical routine requires valid
              variant calling results. However, evaluation of several commonly
              used tools has pointed out that not a single tool meets this
              requirement. False positive as well as false negative calls
              necessitate additional experiments and extensive manual work.
              Intelligent combination and output filtration of different tools
              could significantly improve the current situation. Results: We
              developed appreci8, an automatic variant calling pipeline for
              calling single nucleotide variants and short indels by combining
              and filtering the output of eight open-source variant calling
              tools, based on a novel artifact- and polymorphism score.
              Appreci8 was trained on two data sets from patients with
              myelodysplastic syndrome, covering 165 Illumina samples.
              Subsequently, appreci8's performance was tested on five
              independent data sets, covering 513 samples. Variation in
              sequencing platform, target region and disease entity was
              considered. All calls were validated by re-sequencing on the same
              platform, a different platform or expert-based review.
              Sensitivity of appreci8 ranged between 0.93 and 1.00, while
              positive predictive value ranged between 0.65 and 1.00. In all

              on tumor evolution and in promoting resistance, recurrence, and
              death. We seized a rare opportunity to characterize treatment
              effects and the evolution of a single patient's ependymoma across
              four recurrences after different therapies. A combination of
              high-depth whole-genome and exome-based DNA sequencing of
              germline and tumor specimens, RNA sequencing of tumor specimens,
              and advanced computational analyses were used. Treatment with
              radiation and chemotherapies resulted in a substantial increase
              in mutational burden and diversification of the tumor subclonal
              architecture without eradication of the founding clone. Notable
              somatic alterations included a MEN1 driver, several epigenetic
              modifiers, and therapy-induced mutations that impacted multiple
              other cancer-relevant pathways and altered the neoantigen
              landscape. These genomic data provided new mechanistic insights
              into the genesis of ependymoma and pathways of resistance. They
              also revealed that radiation and chemotherapy were significant
              forces in shaping the increased subclonal complexity of each
              tumor recurrence while also failing to eradicate the founding
              clone. This raises the question of whether standard-of-care
              treatments have similar consequences in other patients with
              ependymoma and other types of brain tumors. If so, the
              perspective obtained by real-time genomic characterization of a
